Python version of [Tibia NoDie](https://github.com/sergiorosendo/tibia_no_die).

## Under development

Currently under development. Python features used: 

- OOP
- Threads
- Macros
- Keyboard control
- .json and .ini files parsing

### Objective

The python version aspires to be a more scalable, maintanable version of the ahk bot. 

NoDie Py aspires to be a game inside the game. It should have access to player vocation, resources, hotkeys, game window and be able to take the best action in every scenario.

#### Avoiding Detection

The bot should also try to hide itself. It will avoid repetitive behavior while still being extremely efficient in assisting the player.

#### Auto Healer - Global Server vs Ot Servers

The main Tibia server does not allow external software to directly access the game window, which is a invaluable source of information. 
A workaround for this exists but, due to limited access, the healer should have slower reaction times. So for the main Tibia Client, the current plan is to develop a auto mana healer, as it can be useful even if reacting with slightly higher delay.

As for Otservers, if the bot has unrestriscted access to the game window, the healer should be able to manage both hp and mp, while being extremely fast and smart.
